#Handwriting-detection-with-text-to-speech
It is a fundamental classification problem that incorporates Convolution Neural Networks to perform analysis of given data and then predict to which class it belongs. Here classes are basically the alphabets i.e A-Z and numbers 0-9. The model used for prediction was trained and achieved an accuracy of 99.2% and then was incorporated in a local server based application with the help of flask where and character was draw on a canvas and then it was predicted and also transformed into Speech using gTTs.
